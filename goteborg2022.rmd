# A rarely harmful extreme weather event in Denmark

- 2013 __storm surge__ after 'Bodil' 

--

- Detailed, case-level **storm surge insurance data** (Danish Storm Council)

--

- Flooding measured at the level of __1,386 polling districts__

--

- 3 treatment definitions (dummies):

    1. **Rehousing:** 1+ cases of rehoused residents   
    2. **Damage:** storm surge damage (DKK) above avg. in affected areas
    3. **Flooding:** 1+ storm surge cases

--

- Matched with **main outcome:** _district vote share for pro-climate parties_ (1994-2019)

--

- Difference-in-differences (DID) design

--

***

> __RQ: How does an extreme, costly flood event affect electoral support for pro-climate parties and candidates?__

---

# Theory

- Ample evidence that __extreme weather experiences can affect climate change perceptions and attitudes__

--

- But limited evidence that weather experiences affect __actual behavior__ &mdash; environmental or political

--

- Several studies exist, but they are framed in a different way &darr;

--

    - __natural disasters__ &rarr; __electoral behavior__
    
    - __retrospective voting:__ rewarding or punishing incumbents based on how they handled the event
    
    - still mixed results: sometimes punishment, sometimes reward
    
--
    
- What if it's more about **policy:** 

    - voters updating preferences on climate adaptation and mitigation<br>(and/or parties and candidates adopting pro-climate policies to attract voters)

    - some evidence: e.g., "a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood" (Baccini & Leemann, 2021)

# Part II: support for pro-climate candidates

# Part II: candidate data from 2017 local elections

*Key variables:*

- (1) *Outcome:* **being elected (binary)** in 2017, 2013 (and 2009)

--

- (2) Running in a **treated municipality (binary)** w/ 10+ rehousing cases

--

- (3) Running on a **pro-climate platform (binary)** w/ climate as key issue or high climate score

# Conclusion

> __RQ: How does an extreme, costly flood event affect electoral support for pro-climate parties and candidates?__

--

- __Case:__ Denmark, 2013 storm surge 'Bodil' and surrounding elections

--

- __Data:__ Detailed flooding damages and vote shares for parties and candidates

--

- __DID design__

--

- __Results:__

    - Pro-climate (left-green) parties gain at least 1.5 pp
    
    - Pro-climate candidates see their election chances increase by 6 pp vs. non-climate candidates

Still plenty of black boxes and additional analysis and interpretation to do ...
