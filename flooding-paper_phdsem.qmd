# Background

## Background: extreme weather experience &rarr; behavior {transition="slide-in none-out" background-transition="slide-in none-out"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
> _RQ: How does climate-related extreme weather experience affect pro-climate voting?_

:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Ample evidence that extreme weather experience affect __climate change perceptions and attitudes__
- But limited (and mixed) evidence that weather experiences affect _actual behavior:_
    1. __environmental behavior:__ it does *not* increase private energy saving, recycling, etc. (e.g. Rüttenauer 2021)
    2. __information/communication behavior:__ it *can* increase Twitter climate discussion, community dicussion, and web searches (e.g. Boudet et al. 2019; Osberghaus & Demski 2019; Sisco et al. 2017)
    3. How about more collective, _political behavior?_ 
        - **Pro-climate voting!**

__Pro-climate voting:__

::: {.incremental}
- _"a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting_ [20 %-points] _after experiencing a flood"_ (Baccini & Leemann 2021)
- Californian wildfires increase support for costly, pro-environment policies by 5-6 %-points (Hazlett & Mildenberger 2020)
- Studies of __retrospective voting and natural disasters__ sometimes show electoral rewards for (relatively) pro-climate parties (e.g. Gasper & Reeves 2011; Bechtel & Hainmueller 2011)
- Some null findings (e.g. Hilbig & Riaz, 2022; Melville-Rea 2022)

# Study I: how the vote share of pro-climate parties increases after the flood {background-color="#8b2325" transition="slide" background-transition="slide"}

## Study I: voting for pro-climate parties

- Level of analysis: __1,386 polling districts__

- Context: Danish parliamentary elections 1998-2019 (focus on 2011-2015)

- Outcome: __district vote share for pro-climate parties__ 
    - left-green bloc w/ strong _issue ownership_

- Matched with district flooding based on __3 treatment definitions__ (all binary):
    1. Storm surge __damages__ (USD) above average
    2. 1+ cases of __rehousing__ cases
    3. 1+ total __flooding__ cases

- Difference-in-differences (DID) design

## Study I: parallel trends

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
include_graphics("/Users/soren/Work/Papers/flooding-pplaces/Graphics/parallel_trends_plot.png")

&rarr; _generally, parallel pretrends (with some imbalances) --- 2015 (Post) stands out!_

```{r}

```

&rarr; _flooding effect on pro-climate voting approx. 2-4 %-points_

## Study I: DID robustness - propensity-score matching 

<br>

::: {.nonincremental}
- Following Abadie (2005)
- **Matching on relatively unbalanced covariates** (possible confounders):
    - ln(polling district area), ln(distance to the water), ln(historical average turnout), academic education (%), primary education (%), ln(median income), ln(total wealth), single-family homes (%)
- __DID estimate (damages):__ 2.06 (bootstrapped 95% CI: [1.11, 3.02])
- No placebo effects

&rarr; _flooding effect robust to covariate matching_

# Study II: how voters reward pro-climate candidates with higher election chances after the flood {background-color="#8b2325" transition="slide" background-transition="slide"} 

## Study II: voting for pro-climate candidates

<br>

- Level of analysis: __9,554 election candidates__

- Context: Danish local elections 2009-2017 (focus on 2013-2017)

- Outcome: __elected or not__ (binary)

- Data: __candidate survey__ w/ climate-related policy responses from 73% of candidates

- __Pro-climate candidate (binary):__ climate as key priority or climate score above 4/5

- Treatment: __high economic damage__ in municipality where candidate is running

- Triple differences (DIDID) design

## Study II: expectation

::: {.notes}
- $Treatment\:group \times Post$: electoral punishment of -4.0 pp for non-climate candidates because of the flood (small reward for pro-climate)
- $Climate \:candidate \times Post$: no change over time (1 pp) in election chances of *non-climate candidates in non-flooded areas*
- $Treatment\:group \times Climate \:candidate$: election chances of _pro-climate candidates in flooded areas_ were only slightly higher *before the flood* (2.3 pp)

## Conclusions 2/2

:::: {.columns}

> _RQ: How does climate-related extreme weather experience affect pro-climate voting?_

:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.incremental}
- Pro-climate __parties__ (left-green bloc) gain around 2 %-points (or more) in flooded areas
- Pro-climate __candidates__ see their election chances increase by 7.8 %-points vs. non-climate candidates
    - (more for candidates in the pro-climate parties)
- Extreme weather experiences can have significant, long-lasting effects on actual behavior &rarr; __pro-climate voting__
- Voters connect weather events to climate policy (at least implicitly) and make voting decisions on this basis
