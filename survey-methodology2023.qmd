## Background

- Academics and climate communicators are looking for ways to promote public support for  
- Widespread idea: (Psychological) **distance** is preventing people from engaging
- Climate change and sea-level rise are too abstract risks
- Many believe it will mostly harm future and far-away populations
- not *personally relevant*
- Hypothesis: Communicating about *personalized* risks will improve concern and support
    - **personalized risk messaging:** local coastal flooding caused by sea-level rise
- Empirical question! 
- And empirical evidence is mixed (among other things due to methodological differences and issues, e.g., ambiguous treatments)
    
## Research question

<br><br>

> "not clear whether personalized risk messaging will have the effects on public risk attitudes that many advocates and practitioners hope", i.e., the effects on "sea-level rise risk perceptions in vulnerable coastal areas"

> **Does providing people with information about projected coastal flooding in their area increase their concern about climate change and willingness to pay for regional adaptation measures?** 

## Sample

- Qualtrics
- Households
- San Francisco Bay area, nine counties (329 zip code areas, 258 areas with 1-17 respondents)
- Not matching zip codes: 18% (assumed movers, against 11% in US within a year), uses self-reports
- N (complete) = 2201
- XX respondents exited because their self-reported zip code was not in SFB area

## Survey design with three sections

1. Background questions, including zip code, ideology, and belief in global warming
2. Map treatment (or nothing in clean control group)
3. Outcomes: Concern about sea-level rise and WTP for adaptation policy

## Background questions

<br>

**Zip code.** *In this survey, we would you like to ask you some questions about your local experiences. To let us ask you questions that are relevant to your community, __please let us know your 5-digit zip code in the box below.__*

<br>

**Ideology.** *One way that people talk about politics in the United States is in terms of left, right, and center, or liberal, conservative, and moderate. __Where would you place yourself on that spectrum?__*

<br>

**Global warming belief.** *Recently, you may have noticed that global warming has been getting some attention in the news. Global warming refers to the idea that the world’s average temperature has been increasing over the past 150 years, may be increasing more in the future, and that the world’s climate may change as a result. What do you think: __Do you think that global warming is happening?__*

## Map treatment

**Flood projection tools: KAMP: 3m**

## Treatment

- Treatment group 1: projected flooding with **1m sea-level rise**
- Treatment group 2: projected flooding with **1m sea-level rise plus 100-year storm**
- Control group: nothing
- Source: U.S. Geological Survey's Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) project
- 20 seconds!
- Projected California SLR in 2100 (77 years): Between 49 and 104 cm above the 1991-2009 average (67% chance)
- Hard to understand?

*This map shows the ﬂooding risk in your zip code from a 1 m (3.28 feet) sea-level rise. (The map may take a few moments to load). The hatched blue lines indicate the parts of your zip code that will be ﬂooded. If you don’t see any hatched blue lines, there will be no ﬂooding associated with sea-level rise in your zip code. The black lines just give the boundaries of the zip code so that you can more easily ﬁnd the general location of your home on this map. Please spend a few moments looking at this map. A red button will appear in a few seconds that will let you move on to the next page.*

## Two outcomes {.nonincremental}

<br>**1) How much do you think sea-level rise will harm...?**

1. You personally
2. People in the Bay Area
3. People in the United States
4. People in developing countries
5. Future generations

*Not at all (1), Only a little (2) , A moderate amount (3), A great deal (4), Don’t know*

<br><br>**2) WTP for regional adaption measure (details in a minute)**

## Willingness-to-pay (WTP)

<br>

1. Inform about the _recent passage of **ballot Measure AA** to fund the San Francisco Bay Clean Water, Pollution Prevention and Habitat Restoration Program, which **restored wetlands across the Bay Area through a $12 annual land parcel tax, offering substantial climate adaptation benefits.**_
2. _If another ballot initiative was offered for a parcel tax of \[MONEY AMOUNT] per year to [USE CASE], would you support this ballot measure or not?_
    - MONEY AMOUNT: \$1, \$2, \$5, \$10, \$20, \$50, \$100
    - USE CASE: "build flood control infrastructure", "prevent the impacts of sea-level rise", "support wetlands restoration"
3. Estimate WTP by modelling support (binary) for the future ballot measure as function of randomized dollar amount in treatment and control group

## Results 4: WTP

<br>

- Negative effect of cost in both groups: $4.76 (treatment group) and $4.00 (control group) increased costs reduces support by 1%
- But no difference between treatment group and control group:
- "Encouragingly, negative responses to ﬂooding risk maps did not translate into a reduced willingness-to-pay for proposed climate adaptation infrastructure"

## Why *reduced* concern?

Theoretical reasons why it need not be true:

1. fear &rarr; avoidance; "false" warnings; backlash from exaggerated fear appeals
2. construal-level theory: qualitatively different engagement with risk, depending on distance; salience and distance are different
3. ideologically grounded motivated reasoning
4. Individuals who believe in climate change may have assumed they were more at risk than these maps suggest; as a result, they update their sense of personal vulnerability post-treatment. In other words, individuals may rely on their pre-existing beliefs about climate change to inform evaluations of personal harm.
    - in the absence of speciﬁc information about local ﬂooding, individuals may rely on their strong climate change beliefs to inform sea-level rise risk perceptions. But when confronted with more speciﬁc information, those same individuals may begin to process the sea-level rise threat in the context of diﬀerent emotional and cognitive considerations, and ﬁxate more on speciﬁc local risk factors.

## Issues

1. Sample / generalizability
    - SF Bay, Qualtrics, Households, US
    - unbalanced even at that
    - Response rates 8-12%
    - Sampling procedure, slightly obscure?
    - Zip code sampling and then select subjective
    - external validity
    
2. Treatment
    - Priming vs. information? Problem that it is not placebo-controlled (also that there is no difference between two map types)
    - What do people take from information? A majority takes that they are safe, assumedly? A minority that that will be hurt? On average: reduction. Tendency to increase close to 50%, to decrease at lower. 
    - Zip-code level abstract and not valuable on its own
    - Social/general/abstract risk much more important?
    - Very hard to understand risk information in maps

3. Outcome questions
    - WTP: small/hard policy vignette. Inattention?! Hard to understand? Some select randomly? No inattention check regarding the vignette and/or treatment AMOUNT. 
    - Will it harm you? "How much do you think sea-level rise will harm...", qualitative/verbal. Problem or not depending on what it is used for. Essentially subjective expectations (beliefs)? But referred to as "Public [Harm] Concern"...
