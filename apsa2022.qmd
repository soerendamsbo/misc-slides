## Extreme weather experience and behavior

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
- Ample evidence that __extreme weather experiences can affect climate change perceptions and attitudes__

- But limited evidence that weather experiences affect __actual behavior__ &mdash; environmental or political

- e.g., "a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood" (Baccini & Leemann, 2021)

> _RQ: How does climate-related extreme weather experience affect pro-climate voting?_

## The 2013 storm surge in Denmark

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
include_graphics("media/flooding_map_timeline.png")
```

- A rarely harmful and costly weather event &rarr; "Hurricane Sandy-equivalent"
- **Data** from the Danish Storm Council public insurance scheme
- Local flooding measured with detailed and complete **storm surge insurance cases**

# Study I: how the vote share of pro-climate parties increases after the flood

## Study I: pro-climate parties

- Level of analysis: __1,386 polling districts__

- Three binary treatment definitions:

    1. Storm surge damages (USD) above average (_damages_)
    2. 1+ cases of rehoused residents (_rehousing_ cases)
    3. 1+ storm surge cases (total _flooding_ cases)

- Flooding matched with **main outcome:** _district vote share for pro-climate parties_ (DK, 1994-2019)

- Difference-in-differences (DID) design

## Study I: main DID results - flooding intensity

## Study I: alternative baseline

## Study I: propensity-score matching 

::: {.nonincremental}
- Abadie (2005)
- ln(polling district area), ln(distance to the water), ln(historical average turnout), academic education (%), primary education (%), ln(median income), ln(total wealth), single-family homes (%)
- __DID estimate (damages):__ 2.06 (bootstrapped 95% CI: [1.11, 3.02])
- No placebo effects

# Study II: how voters reward pro-climate candidates with higher election chances after the flood

## Study II: pro-climate candidates

- Data: comprehensive __candidate survey__ of 2017 local election candidates (N=9,554)

- w/ policy responses from 73% of candidates

- *Key variables:*

1. *Outcome:* **being elected (binary)** in 2017, 2013 (and 2009)

2. Running in a **treated municipality (binary)** w/ high economic damage

3. Running on a **pro-climate platform (binary)** w/ climate as key issue or high climate score (~32%)

. . .

__RQ: Do pro-climate candidates benefit in flooded areas?__

_Triple differences (DIDID):_

&rarr; we should expect **a positive difference in DID estimates** for pro-climate vs. non-climate candidates

## Study II: pro-climate candidates

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
include_graphics("media/proclimate_candidates_kv2017.png")
```

## Study II: main DIDID results

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 65%
include_graphics("media/didid.png")
```

::: {.notes}
- $Treatment\:group \times Post$: electoral punishment of -4.0 pp for non-climate candidates because of the flood (small reward for pro-climate)
- $Climate \:candidate \times Post$: no change over time (1 pp) in election chances of *non-climate candidates in non-flooded areas*
- $Treatment\:group \times Climate \:candidate$: election chances of _pro-climate candidates in flooded areas_ were only slightly higher *before the flood* (2.3 pp)

## Study II: main DIDID results

<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="43%"}
```{r}
include_graphics("media/didid.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

- __All parties:__ approx. 5.5 %-points

- __Pro-climate parties:__ approx. 11.2 %-points

- &rarr; _pro-climate candidates are rewarded in post-flooding elections_

## Study II: DIDID placebo test

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
include_graphics("media/did_estimates_2x2_candidates.png")
```


- DIDID effects from most flooding intensities
- No placebo DIDID effects
- Also no DIDID for other candidate features: incumbency and pro-welfare

## Conclusion

> __RQ: How does climate-related extreme weather experience affect pro-climate voting?__

. . .

- __Case:__ 2013 storm surge and surrounding Danish elections

- Detailed insurance **data** on local flooding

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
include_graphics("media/twostudies.png")
```

## Conclusion

> __RQ: How does climate-related extreme weather experience affect pro-climate voting?__

- Pro-climate __parties__ (left-green bloc) gain at least 1.5 pp in flooded areas

- Pro-climate __candidates__ see their election chances increase by 6 pp vs. non-climate candidates

- Importance of __policy__ and the __long-lasting effects__ suggest quite __sophisticated voting behavior__ (not *only* retrospective voting)
