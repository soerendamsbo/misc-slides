# A rarely harmful extreme weather event in Denmark

- 2013 __storm surge__ after the winter storm 'Bodil'

--

- Flooding measured with detailed, case-level **storm surge insurance data** (Danish Storm Council)

--

- Aggregated at level of __1,386 polling districts__

--

- 3 treatment definitions (dummies):

    1. **Rehousing:** 1+ cases of rehoused residents   
    2. **Damage:** storm surge damage (DKK) above average
    3. **Flooding:** 1+ storm surge cases

--

- Flooding matched with **main outcome:** _district vote share for pro-climate parties_ (DK, 1994-2019)

--

    - ... and, later, the __secondary outcome__: _election chances for pro-climate candidates_

--


--

- Difference-in-differences (DID) design

--

***

> __RQ: How does an extremely costly flood event affect voting for pro-climate parties and candidates?__

# Theory

- Ample evidence that __extreme weather experiences can affect climate change perceptions and attitudes__

--

- But limited evidence that weather experiences affect __actual behavior__ &mdash; environmental or political

--

- Several studies exist, but they are framed quite differently:

--

    - __natural disasters &rarr; retrospective voting__ 
    
    - i.e., rewarding or punishing incumbents based on how they handled the disaster (or blindly)
    
    - __still mixed results:__ sometimes punishment, sometimes reward
    
--
    
- How about **policy?** 

    - more sophisticated voter behavior: updated __voter preferences__ on climate adaptation and mitigation
    
    - and/or policy or strategy shifts among parties and candidates

    - e.g., "a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood" (Baccini & Leemann, 2021)

# Part II: support for pro-climate candidates

Data: comprehensive __candidate survey__ of 2017 local election candidates (N=9,554)
    
- w/ policy responses from 73% of candidates

--

*Key variables:*

- (1) *Outcome:* **being elected (binary)** in 2017, 2013 (and 2009)

--

- (2) Running in a **treated municipality (binary)** w/ 10+ rehousing cases

--

- (3) Running on a **pro-climate platform (binary)** w/ climate as key issue or high climate score (~32%)

# Results: DIDID estimate

???

- $Treatment\:group \times Post$ (-0.048\*\*\*): electoral punishment of -4.8 percentage points for non-climate candidates because of the flood (small reward for pro-climate)
- $Climate \:candidate \times Post$ (-0.008): no change over time in election chances of *non-climate candidates in non-flooded areas*
- $Treatment\:group \times Climate \:candidate$ (0.017): election chances of pro-climate candidates in flooded areas were the same as other candidates' *before the flood*

.pull-right[
- &rarr; approx. __6 percentage points__ difference (DIDID)

- __pro-climate candidates are rewarded in post-flooding elections__ (long after the event)

- not clear if voters change preferences or candidates (parties) change policy or strategy
]

- also no effect (DIDID) for other candidate features, e.g., __incumbency__ and __pro-welfare platform__

# Conclusion

> __RQ: How does an extremely costly flood event affect voting for pro-climate parties and candidates?__

--

- __Case:__ 2013 storm surge and surrounding Danish elections

--

- __Data:__ Detailed insurance data, comprehensive candidate survey, administrative party vote shares

--

- __DID design__

--

- __Results:__

    - Pro-climate __parties__ (left-green) gain at least 1.5 pp
    
    - Pro-climate __candidates__ see their election chances increase by 6 pp vs. non-climate candidates

--

- Importance of __policy__ and the __long-lasting effects__ suggest quite __sophisticated voting behavior__ (not *only* retrospective voting)

--

Still plenty of black boxes, analysis and interpretation to do...
